    <h1>Jan 8, 2:44 PM - Blog #3</h1>
    <p>Welcome back to Blog #3! Lots of stuff has happened in the past few weeks so let's get right into it.</p>
    
  <p>When I wrote my last entry it was Christmas Eve and Joe and I just finished a 12-hour coding day where we started to build our first basic program in Wix Velo code. After that I began to reach out to developers for help as I realized there was too much to learn and we needed some guidance and help to build our first version of the calculator. Below is a picture of the message I sent out to our developers.</p>

  <p>After I sent this I got a response very quickly from the S9 Consulting Developers and we hopped on a call on Dec 26th. I was impressed with their response time and commitment to work over the holidays. It became apparent very quickly that they would be the first developers we hired to help with our MVP.</p>
