Hi there! Welcome to my blog. 

The goal of this blog is to document my journey as I build my first product. I am building a carbon calculator and I want to document every step of the way to show the process from Idea to Reality

I hope this blog can be used for future developers to see my thought process and methods in building and how I came to the conclusions I did 

It will also be cool to learn more about HTML website and Github as that is how I am hosting this blog. 

Thanks and I hope you enjoy!
